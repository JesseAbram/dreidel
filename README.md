# dreidel
I wanted to play dreidel on the blockchain at our Christmas party this should workish. 


legit spent like 5 min on it no judgments. 

Find a trusted party, everyone pays in a determined amount each time they spin.

The trusted party calls the win half function if the spiner spins a hey, or clals the win all function if a spiner spins a gimal

The spinner then must withdraw the balance before the next spiners turn. 


I added a pseudo random number generator, need to integrate that into tbe game so you can play drediel on the contract itself.
